# Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.

Billionaire businessman and arms industry playboy Tony Stark is kidnapped by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings in hostile Middle Eastern space. During his imprisonment he is forced to create a weapon to save his life, but in the process he questions his profession, his legacy and even his own philosophy.

Kevin Feige one day had a meeting like the one Samuel L. Jackson has in the post-crime scene with Jon Favreau in which he told the director "I'm here to tell you about the Avengers initiative. And Favreau just smiled.

Ironman is excellent for laying the foundation for what would eventually build Marvel and Disney Studios over the next 10 years, but it has also improved, as has Stark's first suit, the Mark I, which would eventually become an idea that would revolutionize the film industry market for good and bad for many people, just look at what Scorsese has to say about it.

But for those of us who aren't so demanding or, rather, purist in the movies, who like to let ourselves be carried away by the emotion of the action, Ironman more than succeeds in introducing us to one of the most popular characters of the 2000s and who will ultimately remain part of the generations to come. Just as I am a lover of the first Star Wars trilogy, the children of the future will see a young Robert Downey Jr. and say, what good times the old man had.

Without a doubt his two hours are spent like water and enjoyed much more, the story will serve as the structure for some of the future deliveries, there is no other Tony Stark for me that is not Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges is a gift to the world of cinema even though his villainous character falls into clichés and motivations that cannot sustain him as much as what the film represents for the Marvel universe.
